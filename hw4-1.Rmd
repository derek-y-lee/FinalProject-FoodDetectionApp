##Q1: Learn by Doing
&nbsp;
We chose to reproduce the "Deep Learning for Cancer Immunotherapy" blog on Rstudio. It can be found at https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2018-01-29-dl-for-cancer-immunotherapy/.
&nbsp;
Antibody binding is the underpinning of immunology. Since antibodies are peptides, understanding peptide binding can produce treatments for diseases, including cancer.
&nbsp;
Although all 20 amino acids are individually known, it is not possible to be able to fully understand what is happening when multiple peptides form a chain. Given that there are 20 amino acids, for 8-chain peptides, over 25 billion peptide chain combinations are possible and given limited resources for in-depth chemical study of each peptide, deep learning may provide a quick way to classify peptide chains in immunology.
&nbsp;
Being able to predict binding properties of peptide chains quickly may hasten understanding of immunological mechanisms behind natural cancer defenses of the body and possibly enable quick, personalized treatments for cancer.
&nbsp;
We would like to use a deep learning model to be able to predict binding properties. We will use a feed-forward neural network, convolutional neural network and a random forest to predict, from an peptide chain of length 8, whether the peptide is weakly-binding, nonbinding, or strong-binding.
&nbsp;
We will first install necessary packages:
&nbsp;
```{R}
# Keras + TensorFlow and it's dependencies
install.packages("keras", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(keras)
install_keras()

# Tidyverse (readr, ggplot2, etc.)
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

# Packages for sequence logos and peptides
devtools::install_github("omarwagih/ggseqlogo")
devtools::install_github("leonjessen/PepTools")
#Activate packages
library(keras)
library(tidyverse)
library(PepTools)
library(dplyr)
library("readr", lib.loc="/usr/lib64/R/library")
install.packages("randomForest", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(randomForest)
```
&nbsp;
Now, we can run our first model, the feed-forward neural network. The following tibbles indicate what the data looks like and that it is balanced:
&nbsp;
```{R}
#Read-in data
pep_file <- get_file(
  "ran_peps_netMHCpan40_predicted_A0201_reduced_cleaned_balanced.tsv", 
   origin = "https://git.io/vb3Xa") 
pep_dat <- read_tsv(file = pep_file)
pep_dat %>% 
  head(5)
pep_dat %>% 
  group_by(label_chr, data_type) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
```
&nbsp;
The ggseqlogo package can vizualise the sequence motif for the strong binders using a sequence logo. Basically, this means which amino acids in which positions are responsible for strong binding:
&nbsp;
```{R}
pep_dat %>% 
  filter(label_chr=='SB') %>% 
  pull(peptide) %>% 
  ggseqlogo()
```
&nbsp;
Now, we can prepare our data. Each peptide is encoded into a 2-dimensional 'image'. One of such images can be seen below:
&nbsp;
```{R}
pep_dat %>% 
  filter(label_chr=='SB') %>% 
  head(1) %>% 
  pull(peptide) %>% 
  pep_plot_images
```
&nbsp;
We need to encode our data as a tensor; for example, our data is a 3-D array of number of peptides by length of each peptide by number of amino acids, as seen below:
&nbsp;
```{R}
str(pep_encode(c("LLTDAQRIV", "LLTDAQRIV")))
```
&nbsp;
We will now transform the data into 3-D arrays for training and testing, and then into matrices and the y values into an integer vector with 3 classes:
&nbsp;
```{R}
# Turn data into arrays
x_train <- pep_dat %>% 
  filter(data_type == 'train') %>% 
  pull(peptide) %>% 
  pep_encode
y_train <- pep_dat %>% 
  filter(data_type == 'train') %>% 
  pull(label_num) %>% 
  array
x_test  <- pep_dat %>% 
  filter(data_type == 'test') %>% 
  pull(peptide) %>% 
  pep_encode
y_test  <- pep_dat %>% 
  filter(data_type == 'test') %>% 
  pull(label_num) %>% 
  array
# Create final arrays to feed into model
x_train <- array_reshape(x_train, c(nrow(x_train), 9 * 20))
x_test  <- array_reshape(x_test,  c(nrow(x_test), 9 * 20))
y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, num_classes = 3)
y_test  <- to_categorical(y_test,  num_classes = 3)
```
&nbsp;
Here, we define the feed-forward model which uses layers via the piping function:
&nbsp;
```{R}
# Define model
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 180, activation = 'relu', input_shape = 180) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 90, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 3, activation = 'softmax')
```
&nbsp;
Here are the details of the model:
&nbsp;
```{R}
summary(model)
```
&nbsp;
Finally, we can compile our model with proper loss function, optimizer and metrics:
&nbsp;
```{R}
# Train and evaluate model
model %>% 
  compile(
    loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
    metrics = c('accuracy'))
```
&nbsp;
Now, we can run our model using specified parameters (in this case, 150 epochs with batch size 50 and an validation split of 0.2):
&nbsp;
```{R}
# Run model
history = model %>% 
  fit(
    x_train, y_train, 
    epochs = 150, 
    batch_size = 50, 
    validation_split = 0.2)
plot(history)
```
&nbsp;
We can evaluate how the model performed on the 10% of left-out data:
&nbsp;
```{R}
perf = model %>% 
  evaluate(x_test, y_test)
perf
```
&nbsp;
Finally, we can visualize the predictions on the test data, indicating an accuracy of almost 95%:
&nbsp;
```{R}
acc = perf$acc %>% 
  round(3) * 100
y_pred = model %>% 
  predict_classes(x_test)
y_real  = y_test %>% 
  apply(1, function(x) { return(which(x == 1) - 1) })
results = tibble(y_real = y_real %>% 
  factor, y_pred = y_pred %>% 
  factor,
  Correct = ifelse(y_real == y_pred, "yes","no") %>% 
    factor)
title = 'Performance on 10% unseen data - Feed Forward Neural Network'
xlab = 'Measured (Real class, as predicted by netMHCpan-4.0)'
ylab = 'Predicted (Class assigned by Keras/TensorFlow deep FFN)'
results %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = y_pred, y = y_real, colour = Correct)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(label = title, subtitle = paste0("Accuracy = ", acc,"%")) +
  xlab(xlab) +
  ylab(ylab) +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c('No', 'Yes'),
    values = c('tomato','cornflowerblue')) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_bw()
```
&nbsp;
In our twist, we halve the learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0005; this has the effect of making the model less sensitive to new input; we can see the result in the smoothing of the visualization of the training progress:
&nbsp;
```{R}
# Turn data into arrays
x_train <- pep_dat %>% 
  filter(data_type == 'train') %>% 
  pull(peptide) %>% 
  pep_encode
y_train <- pep_dat %>% 
  filter(data_type == 'train') %>% 
  pull(label_num) %>% 
  array
x_test  <- pep_dat %>% 
  filter(data_type == 'test') %>% 
  pull(peptide) %>% 
  pep_encode
y_test  <- pep_dat %>% 
  filter(data_type == 'test') %>% 
  pull(label_num) %>% 
  array
# Create final arrays to feed into model
x_train <- array_reshape(x_train, c(nrow(x_train), 9 * 20))
x_test  <- array_reshape(x_test,  c(nrow(x_test), 9 * 20))
y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, num_classes = 3)
y_test  <- to_categorical(y_test,  num_classes = 3)
#Define model 2
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 180, activation = 'relu', input_shape = 180) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 90, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 3, activation = 'softmax')
# Train and evaluate model
model %>% 
  compile(
    loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
    optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
    metrics = c('accuracy'))
# Compile model 2
history = model %>% 
  fit(
    x_train, y_train, 
    epochs = 150, 
    batch_size = 50, 
    validation_split = 0.2)
plot(history)
acc = perf$acc %>% 
  round(3) * 100
y_pred = model %>% 
  predict_classes(x_test)
y_real  = y_test %>% 
  apply(1, function(x) { return(which(x == 1) - 1) })
results = tibble(y_real = y_real %>% 
  factor, y_pred = y_pred %>% 
  factor,
  Correct = ifelse(y_real == y_pred, "yes","no") %>% 
    factor)
title = 'Performance on 10% unseen data - Feed Forward Neural Network'
xlab = 'Measured (Real class, as predicted by netMHCpan-4.0)'
ylab = 'Predicted (Class assigned by Keras/TensorFlow deep FFN)'
results %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = y_pred, y = y_real, colour = Correct)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(label = title, subtitle = paste0("Accuracy = ", acc,"%")) +
  xlab(xlab) +
  ylab(ylab) +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c('No', 'Yes'),
    values = c('tomato','cornflowerblue')) +
